GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to
copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to
make sure the software is free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.

1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source
    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
    this License along with the Program.

2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a)  You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b)  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.

c)  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
    use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
    including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
    no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
    users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
    telling the user how to view a copy of this License.

3.  You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it) in
    object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
    above provided that you also do one of the following:

a)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
    code.

b)  Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
    to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
    physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code.

4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.

5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.

6.  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
    to these terms and conditions.

7.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

8.  If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the original copyright holder may add an explicit geographical
    distribution limitation excluding those countries.

9.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES.
